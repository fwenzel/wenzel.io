**8ball** is a simple HTML5 "magic 8-ball" app for Firefox OS (and the Web).

You can try it out [on the web]({{ page.website }}) or [install it from the Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/magic-8-ball/).

The app is written completely client-side in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It has 3 modes ("classic", "happiness", and "finances"), each of which give you unique answers and, obviously, valuable life advice.
