**qrcoder** is a simple QR Code generator. I wrote it because I was sick of the numerous QR code generators on the Web that either wrap your text in silly URL redirects, or charge for a service as simple as this.

qrcoder uses [qrcode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) to do the heavy lifting. It enables the project to run completely client-side in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can try it out [on the web]({{ page.website }}).
