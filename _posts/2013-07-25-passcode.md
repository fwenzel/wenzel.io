**passcode** is a simple game for Firefox OS and the Web. It is a ["Hangman"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29)-style game, making you guess a word, one letter at a time.

You can try it out [on the web]({{ page.website }}) or [install it from the Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/passcode/).

The app is written completely client-side in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
