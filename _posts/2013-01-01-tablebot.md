### Note: turntable.fm is defunct, which means this bot won't work any longer. :(

**tablebot** is [turntable.fm](http://turntable.fm) bot written in node.js.

While other turntable.fm bots exist, this one was built to be fairly simple and have a very limited set of functionality.

Noteworthy features include:
* The bot keeps you company if you're the only one DJing. It can get awfully lonely up there.
* It collects thumbs up/down stats and displays them after every song.

The bot can be deployed on a [stackato](http://www.activestate.com/stackato)-based PAAS platform.
