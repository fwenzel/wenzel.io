**Copy ShortURL** is a Firefox add-on. It lets you instantly create a short URL for web pages that you visit, so you can easily share links with friends.

### History

Copy ShortURL was first created for the Mozilla Summit 2010 [Jetpack](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/) competition. It won one of the three prizes awarded in the competition.

The add-on uses a novel approach to the creation of short URLs, by respecting the site creator's "canonical URL" data, and only creating a third-party short URL if the site didn't specify a short URL of its own.

Since its inception, Copy ShortURL has gained a few thousand daily users, along with several new features, like the ability to choose your preferred shortening service.

Copy ShortURL is an open source project developed via github. [Full documentation](http://copy-shorturl.rtfd.org/) is available on readthedocs.
