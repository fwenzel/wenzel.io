**Open in Private Browsing Mode** is a Firefox add-on that simplifies opening Firefox's private browsing mode.

### History
When Firefox first implemented *private browsing mode*, for architectural reasons, it had to close all open windows and open a new, separate instance of itself for private browsing mode. This made opening content in a private window very tedious. To simplify this process, my add-on would add a right-click menu to every link.

You were able to right-click and open the selected link directly in private browsing mode. When you were done, you could right-click again and exist private browsing mode conveniently.

Like many good add-ons, the platform has meanwhile caught up to this behavior, by making the necessary underlying changes to open private browsing mode in a new window without affecting your current, regular browsing session. Firefox also added convenient right-click menu items like the one my add-on introduced. Therefore, the add-on is (happily) obsolete for the latest versions of Firefox.
