**serpent** is an open web version of the game ["snake"][snake].

It serves as a small example of a [canvas][canvas]-based web game. It can be played in any modern browser or mobile device.

By including an open web app manifest and application cache file, the app can be installed natively on the Firefox OS platform and the game can then be played on the device (e.g., Firefox OS phone) without maintaining an internet connection.
