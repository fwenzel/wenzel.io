**django-sha2** adds strong (but backwards-compatible) password hashing support to Django 1.3 and 1.4 (SHA2, bcrypt+hmac).

Perhaps one of my most successful open source projects, django-sha2 was written at a time when the web framework Django still relied on SHA-1 as its default password hashing algorithm. Even before the most recent wave of high-profile attacks on stolen user databases, it was clear that SHA-1 wasn't strong enough an algorithm to ensure the safety of users' passwords in the case of an attack.

I blogged about the [django-sha2 library](http://fredericiana.com/2010/10/12/adding-support-for-stronger-password-hashes-to-django/) back in 2010, and picked up the topic of password hashing once again in a [primer on password storage in 2012](http://fredericiana.com/2012/06/08/lets-talk-about-password-storage/).

Being actively used by numerous Mozilla and non-Mozilla projects, the library has been extended to allow for periodic HMAC key updates (with automated rehashing). It was also updated to work with Django 1.4 and beyond, even though default password hashing methods in Django have meanwhile also been modernized.
